<p>Enterprises often guard their data closely, treating it as a proprietary asset. This creates an environment where innovation is stifled, and collaboration becomes difficult.

<p>In the rapidly evolving field of AI, data has become a crucial asset. However two significant challenges are hampering progress: data isolation by large enterprises, and the difficulty of sourcing specialized data from niche verticals.</p>
<p>Enterprises often guard their data closely, treating it as a proprietary asset. This creates an environment where innovation is stifled, and collaboration becomes difficult. Likewise, when developing AI models, access to diverse, high-quality datasets is crucial. These datasets, particularly in niche areas, are often scattered and hard to obtain.</p>
<p>Hadar is our answer to these challenges. We envision a decentralized data bank, openly curated by the crowd, with accessibility at its core, aiming to democratize data and ignite innovation.</p>
<p>By employing tokenomics, a system that uses tokens to incentivize specific behaviors, our platform encourages users to request, provide, verify, and maintain datasets. The contributors to these datasets stand to profit from their future use, the value of which is inherently tied to the data quality.</p>
<p>Through Hadar, we aim to empower data scientists, researchers, and innovators, providing them with the specific data they need, regardless of their niche vertical.</p>

<p>In the Hadar ecosystem, there are five key roles: Consumers, Curators, Suppliers, Verifiers, and Sponsors. Each role serves a unique function and has specific responsibilities, costs, and rewards.  It’s important to note that these roles are not mutually exclusive - we anticipate and encourage users to adopt multiple roles, fostering a dynamic, multi-faceted participation within the system.</p>

<li><strong>Quality Assurance:</strong> The Curator and Verifiers inspect the data to validate its quality. They use platform-provided tools to ensure the data meets the tender requirements. The review will be conducted on the full data set, which will be made available through our platform dashboard interface.
<ul>
<li>The data is not accessible via API at this stage. This prevents curators from using the data without quality sign-off, thus encouraging honesty and integrity in the process.</li>
<li>Curators have the final say on data quality. Verifiers can raise an issue and make recommendations on the final decisions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sign-off and Reward Distribution</strong>: If the Curator validates the data:
<ul>
<li>The Suppliers and Verifiers receive tokens from the escrow, with the platform deducting a fee from their earnings.</li>
<li>The dataset is then made accessible to all users via the platform API.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Improvements and Deadlines:</strong> If the Curator (or Verifier)  requests improvements:
<ul>
<li>The tokens remain in escrow, and the data remains unavailable via the API.</li>
<li>The Curator provides specific feedback, prompting Suppliers to submit updated data for another round of verification.</li>
<li>There is a 180-day deadline for these changes.
<ul>
<li>If the Curator fails to sign off on the improved data within this period, approval is automatically assumed.</li>
<li>If the Suppliers do not submit the revised data within this period, the request is deemed a failure, and the Curator sign-off becomes impossible. In such a case, the escrowed tokens are returned to the Curator, and the dataset is discarded.</li>

<p>Data suppliers and curators have the flexibility to customize the pricing for their datasets, providing scalability and versatility for data consumers. Here are the possible pricing models:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Per-row micro-transaction pricing</strong>: This model charges consumers for every individual row of data they access. It&#x27;s a granular approach that allows for maximum flexibility in how much data a consumer wants to purchase.</li>
<li><strong>Bulk batch pricing:</strong> This model offers pricing tiers based on the size of the data batch accessed (e.g., 10k rows at price point A, 50k rows at price point B). It allows consumers to access large amounts of data at a reduced cost per row.</li>
<li>**Single price for the entire dataset: **This model sets a flat rate for access to the entire dataset. It&#x27;s the simplest and most straightforward model, particularly useful for consumers who know they need access to all the data in a given dataset.</li>
</ul>

    </h4>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>Aside from the specific pricing models set by suppliers and curators, there will be a base cost associated with consuming data via the platform. This cost is measured in USD per gigabyte accessed via the API. The exact cost will be determined closer to the platform&#x27;s production launch once our infrastructure costs are finalized.</p>
<ul>
<li>New dataset creation payouts: The platform takes a one-off 25% commission from the earnings of suppliers and verifiers for new dataset creations.</li>
<li>API consumption payouts: A 20% commission is also applied to the earnings of suppliers, verifiers, and curators for API data consumption.</li>

</doc-anchor-target>
<p>To support the ongoing development, maintenance, and improvement of the platform, a commission on revenue earned by curators, suppliers, and verifiers is charged:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Dataset Selection:</strong> A sponsor begins by selecting a dataset they wish to sponsor. This could be based on the potential social impact, commercial value, or the sponsor&#x27;s specific interest in the dataset&#x27;s subject matter.</li>
<li><strong>Funding Allocation:</strong> Next, the sponsor adds capital to the platform to cover the costs of consumers accessing the sponsored dataset. This capital can be added using various methods supported by the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Sponsorship Announcement:</strong> Upon successful allocation of funds, the sponsor can proceed to announce their sponsorship. The platform will label the sponsored datasets, helping consumers to identify datasets that can be accessed freely or at a reduced cost.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring Sponsorship Usage:</strong> Sponsors can track the usage of their sponsored datasets. The platform provides detailed statistics, such as the number of consumers using the sponsored dataset, total costs incurred, and remaining sponsorship funds. This data should help sponsors understand the impact of their sponsorship and plan future sponsorships.</li>
<li><strong>Top-Up or End Sponsorship:</strong> Depending on the usage and the sponsor&#x27;s intent, they can choose to add more funds to continue the sponsorship or decide to end the sponsorship when the allocated funds are exhausted. Upon ending the sponsorship, the dataset will no longer be labeled as sponsored on the platform.</li>
</ol>
<p>This sponsorship model fosters data democratization by encouraging the availability of datasets to a wider user base, promoting research and development, and potentially uncovering innovative use cases.</p>

<p>For users who wish to sponsor the cost of accessing one or more datasets, they can follow the following process</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HAD Payments:</strong> Users receiving payment in HAD have the added benefit of staking, subject to local laws and regulations.  The platform uses USDC revenue to purchase HAD from a DEX, which is then deposited into a staking contract on the recipient&#x27;s behalf. Recipients can unstake their HAD at any time, offering them flexibility and control over their earnings.</li>
<li><strong>USDC and USD Payments</strong>: Users who choose to receive payment in USDC or USD will receive their funds directly, with no option to stake.</li>

</doc-anchor-target>
<p>Our platform will provide automated tools and plugins to measure data completeness and validity. Automated quality control measures include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Completeness</strong>: Check for missing, duplicate, outlier, or null values</li>
<li><strong>Validity</strong>: Check for formatting errors, such as inconsistent data types or invalid characters</li>
</ul>
<p>These checks are standard, publicly disclosed, and flag data that falls below a specified threshold. Curators may reduce or require additional automated checks, and suppliers are mandated to rectify or provide explanations for flagged data.</p>

        <span>Open-source data verification tooling</span>
    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>Because data will not be downloadable via our API until it has been finalized, we will provide a system whereby stakeholders can develop and upload additional tooling for data verification within our online interface. This will give stakeholders the flexibility they need to run custom heuristics against the dataset for validity purposes, while at the same time enhancing the overall value of our ecosystem thanks to new and improved tooling.</p>

        <span>Versioning</span>
    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>We will implement version control for datasets. Specifically, there will be per-row version control. This will enable all parties who modify and curate dataset rows to track changes and roll back if necessary.</p>
<p>In addition, we will enable per-dataset change tracking. Once some rows have been modified and signed off as final, the system will increment the overall dataset version. This enables consumers to know when a newer version of the dataset is available as well as make sure that the version they’re currently using doesn’t change due to new data.</p>

    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>Suppliers, when uploading data, are required to provide rich metadata to facilitate seamless data search.</p>
<p>We will allow for subsets of a dataset to be tagged with additional labels. Such tagged subsets will then be fetchable via the API. This will allow users to train models on subsets of a dataset that may have particular properties that are useful to them.</p>
<p>Tagging will usually be done by curators, suppliers, and verifiers on a row-by-row basis. Batch tagging of a selection of rows will also be possible.</p>

    </h1>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>Our platform is managed by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) system, which ensures that no single entity or person can make unilateral decisions about the data. This helps prevent data isolation and ensures that decision-making power is distributed among the community, promoting transparency and accountability. Our governance token - “HAD” - has a capped supply of 10,000,000 tokens.</p>

        <span>Staking and Rewards</span>
    </h2>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>Stakeholders who acquire and stake HAD tokens on the platform are entitled to a proportionate share of 50% of our platform&#x27;s revenue.</p>
<p>Staking encourages active participation and increases the chances of selection for dataset verification tasks. Verifiers who maintain a stake exceeding 500 HAD for a period longer than 90 days have an increased probability of being chosen to verify a dataset. This likelihood is reflected in a verifier&#x27;s &quot;credibility&quot; score, visible next to their profile ID. The score integrates various factors, including the number of successful verifications, and amount and duration of staked HAD, among others.</p>

</doc-anchor-target>
<p>All platform-generated fees, denominated in USDC, contribute to the platform&#x27;s treasury, which is under DAO governance. The DAO can vote to utilize a portion of the treasury funds to buy back and burn a part of the HAD circulating supply from the market. This action is intended to induce scarcity and add further value to the token.</p>
